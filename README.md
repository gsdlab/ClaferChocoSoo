ClaferChocoSoo
===========

v0.3.5.15-01-2014

A backend for [ClaferMooViz](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferMooVizualizer) that uses [ChocoSolver](https://github.com/gsdlab/chocosolver) to solve single-objective optimization problems.
This project is a wrapper that invokes ChocoSolver in a proper way and produces the output in the same format as ClaferMoo does.

* [Alexandr Murashkin](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/amurashk), MMath Candidate. Main developer.
* [Jimmy Liang](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/jliang), MSc. Candidate. Ports to Java 1.7 and Choco3.

Getting Clafer Tools
--------------------

Binary distributions of the release 0.3.5 of Clafer Tools for Windows, Mac, and Linux, 
can be downloaded from [Clafer Tools - Binary Distributions](http://http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/clafer-tools-binary-distributions). 
Clafer Wiki requires Haskell Platform and MinGW to run on Windows. 

In case these binaries do not work on your particular machine configuration, the tools can be built from source code, as described below.

Running
-------------

### Prerequisites

* [Java 6+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

### Running Standalone

1. Running optimization over the Clafer choco output file: 
```sh
java -jar claferchocosoo-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar <file-name.js>
```
This will produce optimal instances in a textual form.

2. Version:
```sh
java -jar claferchocosoo-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar --version
```
Outputs the current version of the tool

### Running as a Backend

* Install [ClaferMooVisualizer](https://github.com/gsdlab/ClaferMooVisualizer).
* Copy the binary `claferchocosoo-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar` to the `Backends` folder. If you built the project from the source code, then the binary should be in the `target` subfolder.
* Put (if exists, just make sure all paths match) the following configuration in the `Server/Backends/backends.json` :

```json
{
    "backends": [
        ....
        , 
        {
            "id": "choco_single", 
            "label": "Choco (single objective only)",
            "tooltip": "A new Choco solver, for single objective optimization only",
            "accepted_format": "clafer_source",               
            "tool": "java",
            "tool_args": ["-jar", "$dirname$/claferchocosoo-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar", "$filepath$"],
            "tool_version_args": ["-jar", "$dirname$/claferchocosoo-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar", "--version"]             },
        ....        
    ]   
}

```
`$dirname$` means the full path to the *Server/Backends* folder, `$filepath$` is the full path to the input JS file being processed.
* If you made any changes to the `backends.json`, then restart *ClaferMooVisualizer*.
* Now the backend should be accessible in *ClaferMooVisualizer* and listen in the `Backends` list.

Building
--------

### Prerequisites

* [Maven 2+](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). Required for building the projects and linking all dependencies
* [ChocoSolver](https://github.com/gsdlab/chocosolver). This is a Maven dependency for the project, so it should be installed (`mvn install`) as well.

### Building

* Using Maven, run: `mvn install` over the project.
* Two binaries will appear in the `target` subfolder: `claferchocosoo-0.3.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar` that contains all the required dependencies and standalone, and `claferchocosoo-0.3.5.jar`, which does not include them.

### Important: Branches must correspond

All related projects are following the *simultaneous release model*. 
The branch `master` contains releases, whereas the branch `develop` contains code under development. 
When building the tools, the branches should match.
Releases from branches 'master` are guaranteed to work well together.
Development versions from branches `develop` should work well together but this might not always be the case.
